# CS235 LAB08
## Notes:
- Learning AGILE through interactive games
- creating a table with all termonologies for agile
- learning differences between Agile, Scrum and Kanban
- understand the roles of the different agiles/scrums/kanban
- differences between all three.
- 

## Reflection: 
This lab was quite interactive as we were put into groups to have sort of a real life experience of how agile works in real life application. Also we wrote up different terminology that we thought were applicable to the agile which was quite fun as it gave me understanding of certain terminologies i may not know or better clarification.

## Questions:
 
#### What are the differences between Agile, Scrum and Kanban?
Kanban has a continuous flow, is easy to adapt, reactive to changes but has no team roles. Its continuous through the whole project and is done when the team needs it.
Scrum has no continous flow, not easy to adapt, non reactive to changes but has team roles. Scrums go through sprints and resets after each iteration, whatever is done will be done after each sprint.
Agile is based ona n incremental, iterative or repetitive approach and change requirements ove through constant feedback. team members are adaptable and need to be optimised for rapid deployment.

#### If provide you a 8-member team, with 4 experised and 3 new developers, and 1 QA. How do you assign their Scrum roles? Explain why.
One of the experts should be the product owner as they set the clear direction and have a responsibility to deliver most value.
QA should be the scrum master holding everything toegher, as they serve more as an organisation and understand the scrum to create the environment
the rest of the new developers and experts should be in the development team to share their thoughts and deliver value while the other two bring the ideas forward and ensure they are aligned with the values.

#### Bob thinks a 5-member team is too small to use Agile. Is he correct? Explain why.
Bob is incorrect as agile recommends usually 5 people as a smaller team may be more productive than larger teams to be optimal.

#### What is the difference between Scrum sprint and Scrum cycle? What is an increment?
A Scrum sprint and cycle is a short period where scrum teams work to complete a set amount of work. They're the same thing.
An increment is where we the sum of the items that was previously created in the sprints before.

#### Is there any drawback of Agile model? If any, explain why.
Some drawbacks to the agile model is that teams tend to get sidetracked due to lack of processes, long term projects will suffer as agile is incremental and level of collaboration may be difficult to maintain throughout the process.
