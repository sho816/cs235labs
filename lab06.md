# CS235 LAB06
## Notes:
- Using databases for two weeks (SQLite)
- testing out basics (SQL query, and DB Browser)
- Will be connecting the database w flask using SQLAlchemy
- good for caching data, embedded environments, only suits low traffic, no administration
-

## Reflection: 
This lab was quite fun, using SQLite to create and visualise a database is something quite interesting and i found the lab not too difficult
unlike the other ones, will be fun to see what next week will bring

## Questions:
 
#### Task 1: Creating conditional select queries

  
#### Task 2: Joining tables

#### Task 3: Creating a table
