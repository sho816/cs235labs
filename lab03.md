Understanding the concepts of HTML
Essentials for HTML page:
Head, which may consist of:
 <title> <script> <style> <link> <meta>
Meta often used for Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) and responsive webpage
Internal JS should be minimized
Basic tags -> Tabe and list in slides
Form triggers an action -> different types of forms (password, email, checkbox, radio, range etc.)
CSS: style most HTML elements in the body (select by element – changes everything with same tag, select by id – for specific element using #, select by class – flexible, most commonly used (Use .)
Reflection: 
This is my first introduction to creating basic webpages and using HTML, I find it very interesting as it provides a front-end developer perspective in comparison to the majority being backend. The basics and understanding of the different concepts, attributes will allow me to strengthen my HTML.
